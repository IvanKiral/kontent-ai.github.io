## Adding new members

> For all Kontent.ai employees - your GitHub profile should have your real name filled (nickname/handle is up to you) and ideally a real-life profile picture.

⚠️ It's strictly forbidden to add users directly to repos. Only teams (roles) can be assigned to repos. This will allow us to manage [RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control).
