## What the Action does 
The action gets the tag version, restores dependencies, and builds the project with a given configuration. Then the tests and code coverage tools are run. Eventually, the artifact is packaged and uploaded to the [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/) and [GitHub Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-releases).
## Notes
- Setting up of .NET environment is performed by [actions/setup-dotnet@v3](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet) action.
- Version tag is extracted using 3rd party [battila7/get-version-action@v2](https://github.com/battila7/get-version-action) action.
- Dependencies are restored by `run: dotnet restore` command.
- Build is performed by `dotnet build` command provided with configuration info and extracted tag version.
- Tests are performed by `dotnet test` command with respective parameters.
- Nuget packages artifacts are uploaded using [actions/upload-artifact@v3](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) action.
- Publishing of the Nuget Package is Performed by `dotnet nuget push` command with respective parameters and API keys.
- Package versions are set using `${{ steps.get_version.outputs.version-without-v }}` - you can find more info in the [documentation of the Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/get-version#version-without-v).
- Artifact is uploaded to GitHub Releases by [Roang-zero1/github-upload-release-artifacts-action@v3.0.0](https://github.com/Roang-zero1/github-upload-release-artifacts-action) action.
- Tokens and secrets are stored in the [Organization Secrets](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-05-14-organization-secrets/).
